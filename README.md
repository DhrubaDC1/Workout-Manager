# Workout-Manager
 An workout management app/site build with MERN where you can view, add, edit, delete workouts.

This is my first MERN stack app. 

# How to run:
First open a terminal and "cd" into backend directory and run "npm start"

Then open another terminal and "cd" into frontend directory and run "npm start"

It will start a server and open a site on your browser. If doesn't automatically, go to localhost:3000
